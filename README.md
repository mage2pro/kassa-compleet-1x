**I am not an author of this extension and do not support it.**  
I have published it here for my convenience of referencing its code from my [forum](https://mage2.pro/c/extensions/kassa-compleet) and implementing my «[Kassa Compleet](https://mage2.pro/c/extensions/kassa-compleet)» extension for Magento 2 (which does not use any source code of this Magento 1.x extension).
